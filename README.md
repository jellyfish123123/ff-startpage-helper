# About

I took this https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/ge86z4/newtab_page_to_local_file_firefox_76_redux/ reddit post and automated it and maybe added some cool features, i got the mozilla.cfg from this post https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1283835. This solved it putting the file directory in the searchbar which i always forgot to delete before typing in a query and it got very annoying.

# Installation
**1.** git clone "this repo" && cd FF-startpage

**2.** ./command.sh "path/to/index.html" 

**3.** deal with any erros it may throw

**4.** profit

## Dealing with any errors it may throw

*if whatever issue you are having is not on here create an issue (duh)*

- rm failed to remove a file
	- dont worry about it

- permission denied errors

	- run the command as root

- just shows mozilla startpage

	- try checking to see if you have other newtab related extensions and fucking with them

## Lisence

Lisences are bloat so i just put it under BSD
